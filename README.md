## General info
The project is an e-commerce web application backed up by ReactJS and its ContextAPI, enabling the client side to function
smoothly and allow data to flow across the application. The backend is built on ExpressJS, used to retrieve and send data to the Firebase database. 
The application provides a seamless purchasing experience on the internet platform, as it handles transactions with Stripe and its API.
The web platform allows users to create accounts and purchase items, which, once purchased, appear on the orders-related page,
where users can see their purchase history, the total amount, and the items themselves..
